# reactive-spring-learning
Step-by-step mastery plan and project journey for learning Reactive Spring (WebFlux + Project Reactor)
- [x] ‚úÖ Completed item

üü¢ PHASE 1: Reactive Programming Concepts
 Understand Reactive Programming principles

 Learn Reactive Streams specification

 Understand Backpressure

 Learn the difference between Push and Pull model

 Explore Mono<T> and Flux<T>

 Learn Cold vs Hot Publishers

 Practice chaining operators (map, flatMap, etc.)

üü° PHASE 2: Spring WebFlux Core
 Set up Spring Boot project with WebFlux

 Create @RestController with Mono and Flux

 Compare WebFlux vs Spring MVC

 Use @RequestParam, @PathVariable, @RequestBody with reactive types

 Implement global exception handling with @ControllerAdvice

 Learn and use WebClient to call external APIs

 Build a CRUD API using in-memory data store

üü† PHASE 3: Reactive Data Access
 Learn about R2DBC (Reactive Relational DB)

 Use ReactiveCrudRepository with PostgreSQL or MySQL

 Implement full CRUD using reactive database

 Use Reactive MongoDB (optional)

 Handle reactive transactions

üîµ PHASE 4: Testing Reactive Code
 Use StepVerifier for testing Mono and Flux

 Use WebTestClient for controller testing

 Mock services with @MockBean and Mockito

 Write unit and integration tests

üü£ PHASE 5: Advanced Reactive Patterns
 Learn and implement Functional Endpoints (RouterFunction, HandlerFunction)

 Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming

 Handle errors reactively using onErrorResume, retryWhen, etc.

 Use Schedulers to control threading

 Apply backpressure strategies

üî¥ PHASE 6: Optional Advanced Features
 Apply Reactive Spring Security

 Integrate with Kafka or RabbitMQ (reactively)

 Add metrics using Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer

 Use Resilience4j for circuit breaker pattern

üèÅ FINAL PROJECT: Capstone
 Build a full-stack reactive system using Spring WebFlux

 Include CRUD, Streaming, and external API calls

 Secure it using Spring Security (optional)

 Add Observability (Actuator, logs, metrics)

 Write complete tests (unit + integration)

üìå Notes
Tools: Java 17+, Spring Boot 3+, IntelliJ, Docker, Postman, Git
